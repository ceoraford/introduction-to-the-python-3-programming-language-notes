# [Introduction to the Python 3 Programming Language](https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-the-python-3-programming-language)

## About

These notes go along with the [Intro to Python3](https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-the-python-3-programming-language) course created by [Will Button](https://willbutton.co/).

I also included some helpful illustrations I use to understand some of these concepts better. I hope they make sense to you too!

## Course Objective

Learners will gain a great working knowledge of Python. Once you finish the course, you will be able to create your own puython projects from scratch.
You'll also be able to jump into an existing Python codebase and read, understand, and contribute to the application.

Enjoy the course!
