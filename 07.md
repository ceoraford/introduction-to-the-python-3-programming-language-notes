# [Perform Math Operations in Python](https://egghead.io/lessons/python-perform-math-operations-in-python)

## Basic Operations

We can perform basic mathematic operations in Python just like we would in any language.

### **1. Adding**

`3 + 4`

### **2. Subtraction**

`3 - 4`

### **3. Multiplication**

`3 * 4`

### **5. Modulus**

`3 % 4`

### **6. Division**

### Python 2

`3 / 4`

This will return 0 since it rounds to an integer.

`3 / 4.`

This returns 0.75, allowing us to see the complete value.

### Python 3

`3 / 4`

This will return 0.75.

`3 // 4`

This rounds to an integer and returns 0.

## Operations with Variables

We can perform operations on variables that hold numbers as well.

```python

a = 3
b = 4
a + b
7

a/b
.75

a//b
0
```

## Naming Variables

Follow these standards when creating and naming varaibles.

- Variable names should be in lowercase.

```python
    sum = 3 + 4
```

- If the variable name has multiple words, we use the snake case standard.

```python
    sum_of_two_numbers = 3 + 4
```

- Variable names shouldn't start with a number. So this would not be valid.

```python
    3_plus_4 = 3 + 4
```
